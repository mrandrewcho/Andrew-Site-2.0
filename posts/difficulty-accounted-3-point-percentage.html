            <hr width="100%">
            <p>
              A few months ago, I came across <a href="https://www.uninterrupted.com/podcasts/1FeGpBvF7WcI6Ac2uyg2qo/road-trippin">"Road Trippin': Richard vs. Channing"</a>, Richard Jefferson & Channing Frye's podcast. Naturally, I proceeded to binge-listen to the entire series throughout the next work week. In one of the episodes, Kyle Korver comes on to the pod, and one interesting topic that comes up is the different degrees of difficulty for 3-point shots.
            </p>
            <p>
            RJ, Channing, and Kyle discuss how Channing would never be able to take the types of three's that Kyle regularly takes. Kyle often takes threes where he's sprinting off a screen, while Channing usually only takes open threes. Some other examples are players like James Harden, who is unafraid to take step-back 30 footers, and players like Draymond Green, who will only take catch-and-shoot threes that are wide open. Not all 3-pointers are the same, yet the most frequently referenced 3-point metrics don't account for this.
            </p>
            <p>
            Starting from the basics, the most simple measure of 3-point mastery is 3-point %.
            </p>
            <!-- Tableau list export of top 15 3P% -->
            <p>
            Obviously, this does not pass the eye test. While some elite shooters like Kyle Korver and Klay Thompson are near the top of the list, not many people would consider Darren Collison or Reggie Bullock the best 3-point shooters in the NBA. To get a more representative view, the most common method is to bring in 3-point attempts into the picture.
            </p>
            <!-- Tableau scatter plot export of 3-point attempts on x-axis and 3P% on y-axis -->
            <p>
            This looks much better. We see the players we typically associate with elite 3-point shooting near the top right, while the poorer 3-point shooters litter the bottom left. This still leaves much to be desired though, as we can see players like XXX seem out of place. The important piece that is left out is the degree of difficulty of 3-point shots. A 22 foot shot from the corner is given the same weight as a 35 foot heave. A wide open 3 is treated the same way as a tightly contested one. And a pull up jumper is viewed identically to a catch-and-shoot shot. In reality, these shots are all vastly different, and players successfully make them at much different rates.
            </p>
            <!-- Tableau table of league average 3-point shots: Distance, Contested/Uncontested, Pullup/CandS -->
            <p>
            With data from <a href="stats.nba.com">stats.nba.com</a>, I sought to create a metric that takes into account the degree of difficulty when calculating 3-point %. Using Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) as a basis I created the following formula for Difficulty Accounted 3-Point Field Goal Percentage (da3FG%).

            </p>
            <p>
            da3FG% =
            ((1/3) * ((Short_3PM + (MediumToLong_3PM * MediumToLong_multiplier)) / ShotDistance_3PA))
            + ((1/3) * ((CatchAndShoot_3PM + (PullUp_3PM * PullUp_multiplier)) / ShotType_3PA))
            + ((1/3) * ((UnContested_3PM + (Contested_3PM * Contested_multiplier)) / DefenderDistance_3PA))
            </p>
            <p>
            To briefly explain, this formula classifies each 3-pointer in 3 (what a coincidence) different ways.
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Shot Distance</p>
                <p>
                Shot difficulty gets more difficult the further the shot is taken from the basket. Short 3's are those taken from 22-24 feet, while medium to long 3's are those taken from 25-34 feet. To account for the increase in difficulty, a multiplier is used. This multiplier is simply the league average 3FG% for short 3's divided by the league average 3FG% for medium to long 3's.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Shot Type</p>
                <p>
                Pull up shots are more difficult than those assisted with a pass. The multiplier is simply the league average 3FG% for catch-and-shoot 3's divided by the league average 3FG% for pull up 3's.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Defender Distance</p>
                <p>
                Shots are more difficult to make when they are contested vs. uncontested. The multiplier is simply the league average 3FG% for uncontested 3's divided by the league average 3FG% for contested 3's.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            Below is a list of players ranked by da3FG%.
