            <hr width="100%">
            <p>
              A few months ago, I came across <a href="https://www.uninterrupted.com/podcasts/1FeGpBvF7WcI6Ac2uyg2qo/road-trippin">"Road Trippin': Richard vs. Channing"</a>, a podcast hosted by NBA players, Richard Jefferson & Channing Frye. Naturally, I proceeded to binge-listen to the entire series throughout the next work week. In one particular episode, Kyle Korver, a well-respected 3-point shooter, comes on to the pod. While the group discusses a whole host of topics, one particular topic that stood out to me was that of degrees of difficulty for 3-point shots.
            </p>
            <p>
              RJ, Channing, and Kyle discuss how Channing would never be able to take the same three pointers that Kyle regularly takes. Kyle often takes threes as he's sprinting off a screen, while Channing usually reserves his shot for wide open, corner threes. The two types of shots are entirely different, yet the most frequently referenced 3-point metrics in today's NBA treat them as the same shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the NBA has evolved to a more 3-point heavy league, the differences in shot difficulty have become more apparent. Let's take the Houston Rockets as an example. James Harden, the focal point of the offense, is unafraid to sling highly contested, step-back shots over 30 feet from the basket. While he has the skill to pull this off regularly, the rest of his teammates do not. Many of the other shooters on Houston's team will instead only pull the trigger when James Harden, Chris Paul, or a screen and roll by Clint Capela, draws defensive attention, and leaves the shooter open for a corner or short catch-and-shoot 3. Eric Gordon, Ryan Anderson, PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, and Luc Mbah a Moute all fit this mold to varying degrees.

              Ah - the good old 3-Point Percentage. 3-Point shots made, divided by 3-Point shots attempted. A highly sophisticated metric that treats a 22-foot corner three the same as a full court heave at the end of a quarter. Obviously, this does not pass the eye test. We see some widely respected shooters like Kyle Korver and Klay Thompson among the leaders, but few people would consider Darren Collison or Reggie Bullock among the best 3-point shooters in the NBA. To accomodate the limitations of this metric, analysts generally resort to bringing 3-point attempts into the picture in an attempt to get a more acceptable view.

              This looks slightly better. We see players we typically associate with elite 3-point shooting in the top right, while the poorer 3-point shooters litter the bottom left. Bringing in the number of 3-point attempts reveals the true story about players like Darren Collison and Jayson Tatum - shooters who take fewer than a third of the threes that Steph Curry takes. However, it still leaves much to be desired. Kevin Durant and LeBron James seem underrated, while E'Twan Moore and Wesley Matthews look overrated.
            </p>

            <p>
              The problem is quite simple. Shot difficulty is still unaccounted for. A 22-foot shot has a much different rate of success than a 34-foot shot. A catch-and-shoot three assisted by a teammate is a lot easier to make than creating your own shot and pulling up for a three. And in case you weren't aware, an uncontested three is easier to make than a contested one.

            <p>
              Thanks to data available at <a href="http://stats.nba.com">stats.nba.com</a>, I sought to create a metric that measures 3-Point % while taking into account the degree of difficulty of the shots. Using Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) as a basis, I created the following formula for Difficulty Adjusted 3-Point Field Goal Percentage (da3FG%).
            </p>
            <p>
            da3FG% =
            ((1/3) * ((Short_3PM + (MediumToLong_3PM * MediumToLong_multiplier)) / ShotDistance_3PA))
            + ((1/3) * ((CatchAndShoot_3PM + (PullUp_3PM * PullUp_multiplier)) / ShotType_3PA))
            + ((1/3) * ((UnContested_3PM + (Contested_3PM * Contested_multiplier)) / DefenderDistance_3PA))
            </p>
            <p>
            To briefly explain, this formula classifies each 3-pointer with 3 (what a coincidence!) criteria.
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Shot Distance</p>
                <p>
                Shot difficulty gets more difficult, the further the shot is taken from the basket. Short 3's are those taken from 22-24 feet, while medium to long 3's are those taken from 25-34 feet. To account for the increase in difficulty, a multiplier is used. This multiplier is simply the league average 3-Point % for short 3's, divided by the league average 3-Point % for medium to long 3's.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Shot Type</p>
                <p>
                Pull up shots are more difficult than those assisted with a pass. The multiplier is simply the league average 3-Point % for catch-and-shoot 3's, divided by the league average 3-Point % for pull up 3's.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Defender Distance</p>
                <p>
                Shots are more difficult to make when they are contested vs. uncontested. The multiplier is simply the league average 3-Point % for uncontested 3's divided by the league average 3-Point % for contested 3's.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

              Surprisingly, the list for the most part looks the same. However, the three additions to the top ten are all widely accepted as elite 3-point shooters: Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, and Kyrie Irving. The three players kicked out of the top ten are: Joe Ingles, Jayson Tatum, and Buddy Hield. To get some more value out of this analysis, lets bring back in 3-point attempts, along with the difference between the Difficulty Adjusted 3-Point % and standard 3-Point %.

              Because the changes are so subtle, the color grain really helps to guide our focus. The darker green players take the most difficult threes, while the darker red players take the easiest threes. Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden take the most difficult threes, and thus are more fairly rewarded with da3FG%. Revisiting the Houston Rockets, you can see that James Harden, Eric Gordon, and Ryan Anderson take fairly difficult shots (apologies to Eric and Ryan for grouping them with the less skilled shooters earlier). PJ Tucker, Luc Mbah a Moute, and Trevor Ariza all take shots with a low degree of difficulty.
