            <hr width="100%">
            <p>
              As an almost lifelong Pistons fan (I'm ashamed to say I didn't have the strength to stick it through 2010-2015), I've come to have mixed feelings about the NBA draft. While the Pistons have had some superb picks in the 80s and 90s, my lifetime has been filled with disappointment after disappointment. Most recently, we passed up on Donovan Mitchell for Luke Kennard, took Stanley Johnson while Devin Booker was still on the board, selected Brandon Knight over Kemba Walker, and of course infamously drafted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=aMBADEPoiTk">kickboxer Darko Milicic</a> with the second pick in the stacked 2003 NBA draft over the likes of Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barring a miracle, the Pistons have no chance at redemption in the 2018 draft. The Pistons, in yet another questionable move, traded away their first round pick as part of the Blake Griffin deal, leaving them with only the 42nd pick in this years draft. Historically, the average lifetime win shares produced by a 42nd pick is a paltry 5.26 wins.
            </p>

            <p>
              While Pistons fans don't have much to get excited about in the upcoming draft, a number of fanbases in the lottery are thrilled at the opportunity to land a star on June 21. Can they trust in their teams to make the right picks though? To help answer this question, we can quantify each franchises historical drafting performance by calculating a Draft Score for every single pick they've made.
            </p>
              <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
                <td>
                  Draft Score =
                  Drafted Player's Lifetime Win Shares - Average Lifetime Win Shares at Drafted Player's Pick Number
                </td>
              </table>
            <p>
              Draft Scores are obtained for every single draft pick made (prior to 1989, there were more than 2 rounds, but only the top 60 picks are evaluated). This score is calculated by taking the difference between the draft pick's lifetime win shares produced and the average lifetime win shares produced by a player at that pick. This measures the value added by each pick, relative to the opportunity (pick #) that the franchise was given.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because we are using lifetime win shares, I've removed the last 5 years of drafts, as these players haven't had sufficient time to make their mark on the league. The drafts evaluated are: 1979 (first year of the 3-point line and the "modern NBA") to 2013.
            </p>

            <hr width="75%">

            <p>
              When we plot out the picks' draft scores, the majority of them across the league fall between 15 and -15. This stems from the fact that the late first round picks and the entirety of the second round have a small variance. The picks that matter are the lottery picks, and the rest are unlikely to alter the states of their franchises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we look outside the interquartile range, we can see the stars and busts throughout NBA history. Karl Malone and John Stockton stand out as some of the best picks ever, as they were selected towards the end of the lottery, yet both played 19 years in the league at an elite level. Michael Olowokandi and Greg Oden stand out for less desirable reasons. Both were taken first overall, but never once topped 5 win shares in a season.
            </p>
            <p>
              By summing up the all the draft scores for each franchise, we're able to rank each franchise's success in the draft.

              Through 35 NBA drafts, franchises have been differentiated by the success of their picks. Oklahoma City sits at the top of the list with a draft score of 572.8 (meaning 572.8 more win shares than expected from the pick numbers they had), and the Wizards round out the bottom with a draft score of -221.3. My Pistons are actually ranked 7th, in part due to their strong upper quartile which is supported by over-performing lower picks like Dennis Rodman, Mehmet Okur, Amir Johnson, and Tayshaun Prince.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this year's draft, there's a consensus No. 1 in Deandre Ayton, but beyond that, theres a lot of different ways the rest of the lottery could play out. Players like Luka Doncic and Michael Porter Jr. have tempting upside, but scouts haven't been able to see them play as much or as closely as they would have liked. There's also a lot of forward projecting that's happening when scouts are looking at freshmen like Jaren Jackson Jr. and Mohamed Bamba. Fans of Sacramento, Atlanta, and Chicago should all be wary, as their teams rank among the worst historically in cumulative Draft Score. Fortunately for them, the other teams at the top of the lottery (Pheonix excluded) all have mediocre scores as well. While I personally have no horse in this race, it'll be interesting to see which teams take chances, and how those players shape the future of their franchise.
